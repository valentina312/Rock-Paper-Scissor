# Rock-Paper-Scissor

Version 2.0
It was not easy to make this GUI interface, but it was very helpful to learn about event listeners and manipulating the DOM.



Version 1.0
I implemented the function requested in the assignment. I added a function to implement a random choice between three numbers, assigning them to a value of rock, paper, scissors.
Had to fix 3 bugs, two of which because of error in variable scopes and one because of a bug not considered in the initial plan of the code.
